The feature I would look at is the ability to change user name

-Create test to check if user name is different from the original name.
-Create code to change user name.
-Call Tests above to see if change has been made.
-Create test to check if new name is valid, i.e. non-duplicate, no illigal characters, etc.
by tryting to do all of those things.
-Create input sanitation code
-Integrate new code after it passes tests with existing profile page/settings page.
